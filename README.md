# WebOCode

WebOCode | Front-End Development Competition

The theme we have selected is E-sports.
#E-Sports attracts a massive number of people in the gaming industry. Millions of fans all around the world watch eSports tournaments via live streaming platforms. So we have implemented live streaming options in our website.

#Five years ago, eSports was a fledgling enterprise, with small audiences and even smaller purses. Today, games like League of Legends, Defense of the Ancient II, Counter Strike: Global Offensive sell out arenas and pay out millions. Most of the famous events provide live broadcasts and big prize pools to the winner teams. We have also added all the upcoming tournament details and linked them with the original registering website, so that the people who see can register easily for the competition.

#There is a shop section where peoples can buy gaming products from e-commerce websites.

#We have also designed a blog section where blogs and contents related to e-sports can be published.

#All references of frameworks, articles, etc. used in this website are given in References.text

#Problems we faced:
This is the second biggest site we are making, but we have not used github so far . We used to share drive links or zipped folder to WhatsApp and so on.
This is the first time we are using Github. So doing those push, pull and commit commands was fun and good to learn.

#New things learned:
We learned how to use Git while working as a team in this hackathon.
